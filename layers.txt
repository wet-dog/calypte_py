no. melanosome layers = 12

in the melanosome layers, each melanosome plus surrounding keratain occupies a
square with area (1000 nm)^2, with an outside keratin fraction:
f_k = 0.05

or, the melanosome area was a square with size:
w = 975 nm

e = 10 nm
N = 10
=> (N + 1)^2 = 121 square air holes

resulting in:
f_m = 0.40
f_a = 0.55

n = A + Bλ^−2

A_k = 1.532
B_k = 5890 nm^-2

imaginary component taken to be negligible

melanin
A_m = 1.648
B_m = 23700 nm^-2

imaginary component
k_m = a_m * exp(-λ / b_m)
a_m = 0.56
b_m = 270 nm

barbule sliced into 10 nm thick layers

f_k + f_m + f_a = 1

the effective refractive index of each slice, and thus the barbule's refractive
index profile:
n_eff = f_k*n_k + f_m*(n_m - i*k_m) + f_a*n_a
